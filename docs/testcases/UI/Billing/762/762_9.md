# Check Groups Storages quota for User Role

Test verifies that
- billing quota for Storages specified for ***Groups*** is applied only on non-admin users
- group billing quota for Storages can be specified for *User Role*

**Prerequisites**:
- Admin user that has `<User_role>` role
- Non-admin user that has `<User_role>` role
- Billing values:
  - *Storages* billing for the `<User_role>` from the Prerequisites for the current quarter is `<billing1>`
- Perform [762_1](762_1.md) case

**Preparations**:
1. Login as admin user from the prerequisites
2. Create 2 *object storages* (`storage1`, `storage2`) and *fs storage* (`fs_storage`). Give all permissions to these storages to non-admin user from the Prerequisites
3. Logout. Login as non-admin user from the prerequisites
4. Open the **Tools** page
5. Select test tool
6. Launch a selected tool with default settings
